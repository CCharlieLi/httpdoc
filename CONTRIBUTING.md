# Contributing to httpdoc

## Documentation

The documentation is written in [YAML][] files under `_docs/`. It’s primarily
intended for Web developers, not as a complete reference of the HTTP standard.

Please keep the language simple, with the following rules:

- Acknowledge your sources, and add them in the `refs` section of any resource
- Keep the text width under 79 characters, including indentation
- Unlike the RFCs, we use lower-cased verbs, like “should” and “must” instead
  of “SHOULD” and “MUST”.
