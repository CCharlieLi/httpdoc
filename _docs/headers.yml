"Accept":
  type: request
  desc: |
    The Accept request-header field can be used to specify certain media types
    which are acceptable for the response. Accept headers can be used to
    indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small set of desired
    types, as in the case of a request for an in-line image.

    The asterisk "*" character is used to group media types into ranges, with
    "*/*" indicating all media types and "type/*" indicating all subtypes of
    that type. The media-range MAY include media type parameters that are
    applicable to that range.

    Each media-range MAY be followed by one or more accept-params, beginning
    with the "q" parameter for indicating a relative quality factor. The first
    "q" parameter (if any) separates the media-range parameter(s) from the
    accept-params. Quality factors allow the user to indicate the relative
    degree of preference for that media-range, using the qvalue scale from 0 to
    1. The default value is q=1.

    Example:
      Accept: text/plain; q=0.5, text/html, text/x-dvi; q=0.8, text/x-c

    Verbally, this would be interpreted as "text/html and text/x-c are the
    preferred media types, but if they do not exist, then send the text/x-dvi
    entity, and if that does not exist, send the text/plain entity."

"Accept-Charset":
  type: request
  desc: |
    The Accept-Charset request header field can be used to indicate what
    character sets are acceptable for the response. This field allows clients
    capable of understanding more comprehensive or special-purpose character
    sets to signal that capability to a server which is capable of representing
    documents in those character sets.

    Each charset MAY be given an associated quality value which represents the
    user's preference for that charset. The default value is q=1. For example:

      Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1;q=0.8

    The special value "*", if present in the Accept-Charset field, matches
    every character set (including ISO-8859-1) which is not mentioned elsewhere
    in the Accept-Charset field. If no "*" is present in an Accept-Charset
    field, then all character sets not explicitly mentioned get a quality value
    of 0, except for ISO-8859-1, which gets a quality value of 1 if not
    explicitly mentioned.

    If no Accept-Charset header is present, the default is that any character
    set is acceptable. If an Accept-Charset header is present, and if the
    server cannot send a response which is acceptable according to the
    Accept-Charset header, then the server SHOULD send an error response with
    the 406 (not acceptable) status code, though the sending of an unacceptable
    response is also allowed.

"Accept-Encoding":
  type: request
  desc: |
    The Accept-Encoding request-header field is similar to Accept, but
    restricts the content-codings that are acceptable in the response.

    Examples of its use are:

       Accept-Encoding: compress, gzip
       Accept-Encoding:
       Accept-Encoding: *
       Accept-Encoding: compress;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0
       Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, identity; q=0.5, *;q=0

    If an Accept-Encoding field is present in a request, and if the server
    cannot send a response which is acceptable according to the Accept-Encoding
    header, then the server should send an error response with the 406 (Not
    Acceptable) status code.

    If no Accept-Encoding field is present in a request, the server may assume
    that the client will accept any content coding. In this case, if "identity"
    is one of the available content-codings, then the server should use the
    "identity" content-coding, unless it has additional information that a
    different content-coding is meaningful to the client.

"Accept-Language":
  type: request
  desc: |
    The Accept-Language request-header field is similar to Accept, but
    restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a response to
    the request.

    Each language-range may be given an associated quality value which
    represents an estimate of the user's preference for the languages specified
    by that range. The quality value defaults to "q=1". For example,

        Accept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7

    would mean: "I prefer Danish, but will accept British English and other
    types of English."

"Accept-Ranges":
  type: response
  desc: |
    The Accept-Ranges header field allows the server to indicate its acceptance
    of range requests for a resource.

    Servers that accept byte-range requests may send

        Accept-Ranges: bytes

    but are not required to do so. Servers that do not accept any kind of range
    request for a resource may send

        Accept-Ranges: none

    to advise the client not to attempt a range request.

"Age":
  type: response
  desc: |
    The Age response-header field conveys the sender's estimate of the amount
    of time since the response (or its revalidation) was generated at the
    origin server.
    Age values are non-negative decimal integers, representing time in seconds.
  refs:
    - http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.6
"Allow":
  type: response
  desc: |
    The Allow entity-header field lists the set of methods supported by the
    resource identified by the Request-URI. The purpose of this field is
    strictly to inform the recipient of valid methods associated with the
    resource. An Allow header field MUST be present in a 405 (Method Not
    Allowed) response.

    Example of use:
        Allow: GET, HEAD, PUT

"Authorization":
  type: request
  desc: |
    A user agent that wishes to authenticate itself with a server– usually, but
    not necessarily, after receiving a 401 response– does so by including an
    Authorization request-header field with the request. The Authorization
    field value consists of credentials containing the authentication
    information of the user agent for the realm of the resource being
    requested.
